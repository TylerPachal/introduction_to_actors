# Introduction to Actors (in Elixir)

These apps are for a talk I did for the Elixir Toronto meetup in January 2018.  They are intended to be studied in order:

1) Basic examples of passing messages between two actors
2) How to arrange actors into an application, so they are initailized on startup and supervised
3) How to do some more advanced things, like `Process.monitor` and `:simple_one_for_one` supervision.
